## Week 1:
[C1_W1_Assignment](https://github.com/curtpond/practical-aws/blob/main/nb/week1/C1_W1_Assignment.ipynb)

[Slides for Week 1](./slides/C1_W1.pdf)
### Objectives
- Set up a Sagemaker domain.
- Create a policy, that includes full AWS Glue permissions, and apply it to the right ARN.
- Use the boto3 API to create, configure, and manage AWS services (S3).
- Use the Sagemaker API to create a Sagemaker session for working with AWS Data Wrangler, Glue, and Athena.
- Create tables in Athena database and run SQL queries for analysis.
- Ingest, explore, and visualize a product review data set for multi-class text classification.

[Slides for Week 2](./slides/C1_W2.pdf)
### Objectives
- Detect data bias with Sagemaker Clarify.
- Analyze class imbalance.
- Create a bias_config and pass it to a Clarify processing job.
- Review output of processing job in HTML format and inspect CloudWatch logs.
- Balance the dataset and re-run  the processing job. Inspect metrics.

- Run experiments with Sagemaker Autopilot.
- Train a text classifier with AutoML.
- Find the optimal feature transformations, algorithm, and hyperparameters.
## Week 4:
[CL2_W4_Assignment](https://github.com/curtpond/practical-aws/blob/main/nb/week1/C1_W3_Assignment.ipynb)

[Slides for Week 4](./slides/C1_W4.pdf)
### Objectives
- Review evolution of text analysis algorithms (word2vec, FastText and BlazingText algorithms)
- Transform raw review data into features to train a text classifier
- Apply the Amazon SageMaker built-in BlazingText algorithm to train a text classifier
- Deploy the text classifier and make predictions
